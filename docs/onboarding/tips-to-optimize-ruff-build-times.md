### **1. Leverage Incremental Compilation**
Rust's incremental compilation is enabled by default in debug mode but not in release mode (due to the optimizations performed in the release builds). Since you mentioned `cargo build --release`, switching to **debug builds** during development may drastically reduce build times for small changes.

**What to do:**
- Use `cargo build` (without `--release`) when iterating. Release builds are more expensive because of optimizations like inlining and link-time optimization (LTO).
- When you need to test performance or release artifacts, only then do a full `cargo build --release`.

---

### **2. Use `cargo check` for Faster Feedback**
`cargo check` analyzes your code and runs the type checker but skips code generation. It's much faster than a full build and is particularly useful for verifying code correctness after small changes.

**What to do:**
- Run `cargo check` instead of `cargo build` to validate changes. This can cut your iteration time significantly when modifying files.

---

### **3. Optimize `sscache` Configuration**
`sscache` is a great tool, but you can tweak its setup to maximize performance:

- **Increase the cache size:**
  Run:
  ```bash
  sscache --max-size 20G
  ```
  or a size appropriate to your storage capacity. This ensures larger compiled artifacts are cached.

- **Verify cache usage:**
  Use `sscache -s` to confirm that `sscache` is actually being used effectively. Look for cache hits and misses.

- **Avoid unnecessary `cargo clean`:**
  Running `cargo clean` invalidates the `target` directory, requiring all dependencies to rebuild. Use `cargo clean` sparingly to retain incremental build data.

---

### **4. Minimize Dependencies and Feature Flags**
Every dependency or enabled feature adds to the compilation time. Audit your `Cargo.toml` and disable unnecessary features during development.

**What to do:**
- Use minimal dependencies and features when iterating.
- You can disable features for specific crates during builds using `--no-default-features` or enable only what’s necessary with `--features`.

For example:
```bash
cargo build --no-default-features --features "core"
```

---

### **5. Parallelize Compilation**
Ensure you’re taking full advantage of multi-core CPUs by enabling parallel builds.

**What to do:**
- Rust builds are automatically parallelized, but you can explicitly control the number of threads with:
  ```bash
  CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=num_threads cargo build
  ```
  Replace `num_threads` with your CPU’s logical core count (e.g., `16`).

---

### **6. Experiment with `lld` as a Linker**
While `mold` isn’t available on Windows, you can use LLVM's `lld` linker, which is faster than the default linker (`link.exe` on Windows).

**What to do:**
- Add this to your `.cargo/config.toml`:
  ```toml
  [target.'cfg(windows)']
  linker = "rust-lld"
  ```
- Or specify it when building:
  ```bash
  RUSTFLAGS="-C linker=lld" cargo build --release
  ```

---

### **7. Use `cargo-llvm-lines` to Identify Hotspots**
If certain files take disproportionately long to compile, you can use tools like [`cargo-llvm-lines`](https://github.com/dtolnay/cargo-llvm-lines) to identify "heavy" modules. This tool helps you find files or dependencies generating excessive LLVM IR, which can then be refactored or optimized.

**What to do:**
1. Install `cargo-llvm-lines`:
   ```bash
   cargo install cargo-llvm-lines
   ```
2. Run:
   ```bash
   cargo llvm-lines --release
   ```
3. Focus on optimizing the modules with the most IR lines.

---

### **8. Profile Your Build with `-Z timings`**
Rust's build system supports profiling with `-Z timings`, which outputs a detailed report showing where time is spent during builds.

**What to do:**
1. Run:
   ```bash
   cargo +nightly build -Z timings
   ```
2. Examine the generated HTML report to identify slow stages or dependencies.

---

### **9. Consider Using a Linux Environment**
If feasible, setting up a Linux environment via WSL2 or a dual boot can improve build times because:
- Linux supports `mold` for faster linking.
- The file system and process management tend to perform better for Rust builds compared to Windows.

**What to do:**
1. Install WSL2 and set up a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu).
2. Install Rust and `mold` in WSL2.
3. Mount your project directory and build inside WSL.

---

### **10. Split Large Crates**
If `ruff` has particularly large modules, splitting them into smaller, focused crates can improve parallelism and reduce incremental build times. Smaller crates are recompiled independently when changes are made.

---

### **11. Other Tools to Try**
- **`cargo-udeps`**: Identify unused dependencies to reduce build overhead:
  ```bash
  cargo install cargo-udeps
  cargo +nightly udeps
  ```
- **`cargo-bloat`**: Analyze build size and performance impact of dependencies:
  ```bash
  cargo install cargo-bloat
  cargo bloat --release
  ```

---

### Summary of Quick Wins
1. Use **`cargo check`** for fast iterations.
2. Switch to **debug builds** for non-optimized development work.
3. Optimize `sscache` usage and avoid frequent `cargo clean`.
4. Experiment with `lld` for faster linking.
5. Profile builds with `-Z timings` and tools like `cargo-llvm-lines`.
